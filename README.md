**`USN Veteran | Software Developer`**

I am a full-stack software developer with a mission to become a titan in the world of coding. I'm still fairly new at this, so most of my repos are of school material. My personal projects however, are built from the ground up with intent for them to become applicable to solving real problems or fulfilling particular needs.

  <summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started out self-learning with Udemy courses on JavaScript in 2022. After finding incredible interest in the subject, I decided to enroll in Code Fellows coding bootcamp using VETTEC benefits starting in January 2023. I graduated CF in July 2023 earning my Advanced Software Development with JavaScript certificate and am now currently working on personal projects while exploring new languages. I have found that Front-End development sparks my interest the most, and have started working on challenges from Frontend Mentor to hone my HTML/CSS/JS skills. Once I've achieved a few projects using JavaScript, I will branch out and reattempt them using another language for a whole new challenge.
