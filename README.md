**`USN Veteran | Software Developer`**

I am a full-stack software developer with a mission to become a titan in the world of coding. I'm still fairly new at this, so most of my repos are of school material. My personal projects however, are built from the ground up with intent for them to become applicable to solving real problems or fulfilling particular needs.
